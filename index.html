                            GitHub, Inc. is an American corporation that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. 
                            It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. 
                            It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, 
                            and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.

                            GitHub offers its basic services free of charge. Its more advanced professional and enterprise services are commercial. 
                            Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open-source projects. As of January 2019, GitHub offers unlimited private 
                            repositories to all plans, including free accounts, but allowed only up to three collaborators per repository for free.

                            The <code>git add</code> command adds new or changed files in your working directory to the git
                            staging area. <br>
                            <code>git add</code> is an important command - without it, no <code>git commit</code> would ever
                            do anything.

                                    Create a new repository on GitHub. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or 
                                    gitignore files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.

                            A <code>git commit</code> is a snapshot of the hierachy (Git tree) and the contents of the files 
                            (Git blob) in a Git repository. These endpoints allow you to read and write commit objects to your
                            Git database on GitHub.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To commit the files that you've staged in your local repository, you need to write this in the terminal:
                            <br><br> <code>$ git commit -m "First commit" <br>
                                    # Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. 
                                    To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit 
                                    and add the file again.</code> <br><br>
                            In terminal, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed: <br> <br>
                            <code>
                                $ git remote add origin remote repository URL <br>
                                # Sets the new remote <br>
                                $ git remote -v <br>
                                # Verifies the new remote URL <br>                            
                            </code>
                        </p>

                        <p>The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. 
                            Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. 
                            It's the counterpart to git fetch, but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, 
                            pushing exports commits to remote branches. Remote branches are configured using the git remote command. 
                            Pushing has the potential to overwrite changes, caution should be taken when pushing. These issues are discussed below.</p>
                        <p>
                            To push the changes in your local repository to GitHub, you need to write in the terminal: <br>
                            <br>
                            <code>
                                $ git push -u origin master <br>
                                # Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
                            </code>
                            <br> 
                        </p>

                            If your site is an independent project, you can create a new repository to store your site's source code. 
                            If your site is associated with an existing project, you can add the source code to that project's repository, 
                            in a /docs folder on the default branch or on a different branch. For example, if you're creating a site to 
                            publish documentation for a project that's already on GitHub, you may want to store the source code for 
                            the site in the same repository as the project. <br>
                            If you want to create a site in an existing repository, skip to the "Creating your site" section.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before you can create your site, you must have a repository for your site on GitHub. 
                            If you're not creating your site in an existing repository, see <a href="#add">Create a new repository and Add files to it</a>

                                <li>Decide which publishing source you want to use (in this case gh-pages).</li><br>

                                    If your chosen publishing source already exists, navigate to the publishing source. 
                                    If your chosen publishing source doesn't exist, create the publishing source.
                                </li><br>

                                    In the root of the publishing source, create a new file called <code>index.md</code>that contains 
                                    the content you want to display on the main page of your site.
                                </li><br>
